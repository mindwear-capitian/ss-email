# Apify Zillow Integration Status

**Date**: 2025-07-03  
**Status**: Partially Complete - Blocked by Missing Agent Data

## Overview

We successfully integrated Apify's Zillow scraper to fetch new real estate listings, but the STR outreach system is blocked because Zillow's public data does not include agent contact information.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Apify Integration
- ✅ Added APIFY_TOKEN to environment configuration
- ✅ Updated strOutreachService.js with correct actor ID: `maxcopell~zillow-scraper`
- ✅ Updated data mapping to handle Zillow's actual response format
- ✅ Configured proper input format with searchUrls and extractionMethod

### 2. Email Finder Services
Created multiple email finder services to search for agent contacts:
- `agentEmailFinder.js` - Uses Crawl4AI LLM extraction (blocked by deprecated API)
- `simpleEmailFinder.js` - Basic web scraping approach
- `webSearchEmailFinder.js` - Google search approach (blocked by CAPTCHA)
- `duckDuckGoEmailFinder.js` - DuckDuckGo search approach (no CAPTCHAs but limited results)

### 3. Environment Updates
- Fixed CRAWL4AI_URL port from 8000 to 8080
- Added APIFY_TOKEN to docker-compose.unified.yml

## Test Results

### Apify Data Quality
- Successfully retrieved 81 properties from Orlando, FL
- Data includes: addresses, prices, property details, broker names
- **Critical Issue**: No agent names or contact information
- Only 72/81 properties had broker names

### Email Finder Results
All email finder approaches failed due to:
1. **No agent names** in the source data
2. **Google blocks crawlers** with CAPTCHAs
3. **Agent emails are protected** - not publicly displayed
4. **Crawl4AI LLM extraction deprecated** - API changes broke intelligent extraction

## Manual Search Findings

When manually searching for property "770 W Webster Ave, Winter Park, FL":
- Found the listing agent: **Ashley Johnston** from Keller Williams Winter Park
- Found multiple KW agent emails (but not the specific listing agent)
- Confirmed that having the agent name would enable successful searches

## Roadblocks

### 1. Missing Agent Data (Primary Blocker)
Zillow's public API/scraping does not provide:
- Agent names
- Agent emails
- Agent phone numbers

Without agent names, searches like "KELLER WILLIAMS agent email" are too generic to yield results.

### 2. Technical Limitations
- **Google Search**: Returns CAPTCHA pages for automated requests
- **Crawl4AI**: LLM extraction API deprecated, breaking intelligent content extraction
- **Real Estate Sites**: Protect agent emails behind contact forms

### 3. Data Protection
Real estate platforms intentionally hide agent contact details to:
- Control lead flow
- Prevent spam
- Maintain data value

## Recommendations

### Short Term
1. **Use different data source** that includes agent information (MLS data, paid APIs)
2. **Manual enrichment** - Have someone manually find agent names for high-value listings
3. **Contact brokerages directly** instead of individual agents

### Long Term
1. **Partner with data provider** that includes agent contact information
2. **Build relationships** with brokerages for direct data access
3. **Use MLS integration** if available in your market

## Code Status

The STR outreach workflow is technically complete but will skip all listings due to missing agent emails. The system architecture is sound and would work immediately if provided with agent contact data.
